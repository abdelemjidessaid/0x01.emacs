# Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

* [Shell](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/9)
* [Using Emacs as editor](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/54)
* [The Framework](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559)



<br><br>


# Congrats!

Now you know how to navigate into a Unix system!

It’s time to test and decide what will be your favorite text editor on your sandbox: <b>Emacs</b> or <b>Vi</b>.

During this project you will play with <b>Emacs</b>.


<br><br>


# Resources

### Read or watch:

* [A Guided Tour of Emacs](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/DdHY8IFvykhK9KOLKTPLVg)


<br><br>



# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/yaKx7FQ4pX3dlx7SNbAStg), without the help of Google:

### General

* What is Emacs
* Who is Richard Stallman
* How to open and save files
* What is a buffer and how to switch from one to the other
* How to use the mark and the point to set the region
* How to cut and paste lines and regions
* How to search forward and backward
* How to invoke commands by name
* How to undo
* How to cancel half-entered commands
* How to quit Emacs

### Copyright - Plagiarism

* You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
* You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
* You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
* Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.


<br><br>



# Requirements

* All tasks <b>must be</b> done inside the sandbox `Ubuntu 20.04`
* Your sandbox <b>must be available at the end of this project</b> - the Checker will access to it at midnight for running the correction!
* The answer of a task must be in a specific file
* Each answer file must contain only the command to execute in Emacs for solving the task. Example: “What is the command to write buffer to a specified file?” -> the file should contain only `C-x C-w`
